802,135-81,"<body><h1>Cochlear Implant Surgery</h1><Section title=""Overview""><h2>What is cochlear implant surgery?</h2><p>If a person has severe hearing loss, a cochlear implant may help. A cochlear implant is different from a hearing aid. A hearing aid makes sounds louder and helps someone who has some hearing loss. But a cochlear implant can help a person with very little or no hearing (partial or complete deafness). </p><p>A cochlear implant is a small electronic device that electrically stimulates the cochlear nerve. This is the nerve for hearing. The device has 2 parts. One part sits behind the ear. It picks up sounds with a microphone. It then processes the sound and sends it to the second part of the implant. The second part is put through the skin and implanted in the inner ear during a surgery. A thin wire and small electrodes lead to the cochlea, which is part of the inner ear. The wire sends signals to the auditory nerve. This is the nerve that sends sound impulses to the brain. A cochlear implant helps give a person a sense of sounds. It doesn't restore hearing to normal. But it can help a person understand speech and noises around them. </p></Section><Section title=""Purpose""><h2>Why might I need cochlear implant surgery?</h2><p>You and your healthcare provider may think about a cochlear implant if your hearing hasn’t improved after using a hearing aid for at least 6 months. You also must have severe hearing loss from an auditory nerve conduction disorder in both ears (sensorineural hearing loss). </p><p>How cochlear implants help is different for each person. Some people can hear many sounds. But some people will have no change in hearing. A person may be able to: </p><ul><li><p>Notice different sounds, such as footsteps, a door closing, a phone ringing </p></li><li><p>Understand speech without lip reading, or be helped with lip reading </p></li><li><p>Understand voices over the phone</p></li><li><p>Hear the TV</p></li><li><p>Hear music</p></li></ul><p>Before thinking about a cochlear implant, it's important to understand certain facts. These include: </p><ul><li><p>A cochlear implant requires training and therapy after surgery. During this time, you will learn how to care for the implant. You will also have aural rehabilitation (rehab) to help with coping with hearing loss. This will help to improve your use of the implant. How long you have aural rehab depends on your age and your hearing before surgery. </p></li><li><p>Cochlear implants don't restore hearing to normal. And in some people, they may not help with hearing at all. </p></li><li><p>You may lose the rest of your natural hearing in the ear where the implant is placed. </p></li><li><p>You may need to use new or recharged batteries every day. </p></li><li><p>You will need to remove the external part of the implant when bathing or swimming </p></li><li><p>The implant may irritate your skin. In some cases, it may need to be removed. </p></li><li><p>Static electricity may harm a cochlear implant. You will need to take care around computer and TV screens, manmade fabrics, carpeting, and other things that make static electricity. </p></li><li><p>An implant can set off security systems, such as metal detectors. Implants may be affected by cellphones and radio transmitters. They must be turned off during takeoff and landing in a plane. </p></li><li><p>You may not be able to have certain medical tests or treatments. These include MRI, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and ionic radiation therapy. </p></li><li><p>The implant can be damaged during an accident or while playing sports. Or the implant can fail. Fixing the implant or replacing a damaged part may be expensive. In some cases, a new surgery may be needed to replace the implant. </p></li></ul></Section><Section title=""Risks""><h2>What are the risks of cochlear implant surgery?</h2><p>Risks of cochlear implant surgery include: </p><ul><li><p>Bleeding</p></li><li><p>Swelling</p></li><li><p>Infection in the area of the implant </p></li><li><p>Ringing in the ears (tinnitus)</p></li><li><p>Dizziness or vertigo</p></li><li><p>Numbness around the ear</p></li><li><p>Changes in taste</p></li><li><p>Leaking cochlea fluid</p></li><li><p>Leaking spinal fluid </p></li><li><p>Injury to the facial nerve, which can cause movement problems in the face </p></li><li><p>Infection of the membrane that covers the brain (meningitis) </p></li><li><p>Chronic inflammation around the implant (reparative granuloma) </p></li><li><p>Risks of general anesthesia</p></li><li><p>Need to have the implant removed because of an infection </p></li></ul><p>There may be other risks, depending on your health condition. Discuss any concerns with your healthcare provider before the procedure.   </p></Section><Section title=""Preparation""><h2>How do I get ready for cochlear implant surgery?</h2><p>A cochlear implant is not right for everyone. To find out if an implant is right for you: </p><ul><li><p>You will need to meet with hearing and speech specialists. These may include an audiologist, otologist, and speech-language pathologist. </p></li><li><p>You will need to meet with a psychologist or other counselor. </p></li><li><p>You will have hearing tests and physical exams. </p></li><li><p>You may have imaging tests to look at the structure of your ear. These may include X-rays and MRI. These can help show how well a cochlear implant will work in your ear. </p></li><li><p>The healthcare staff will help you to shave and clean the scalp around the implant site. </p></li><li><p>Your healthcare provider may need other tests or preparation, depending on your health condition. </p></li></ul></Section><Section title=""During the Test""><h2>What happens during cochlear implant surgery?</h2><p>Cochlear implant surgery is done in a hospital or clinic. The surgery lasts 2 to 4 hours. You are given medicine (general anesthesia) to make you sleep during the procedure. </p><ul><li><p>The surgeon makes a cut (incision) behind the ear to open up the mastoid bone. </p></li><li><p>Then the surgeon makes a small cut in the cochlea. They insert the implant electrodes into the cochlea. </p></li><li><p>The surgeon places an electronic device called the receiver under the skin behind the ear. </p></li><li><p>The incisions are then closed. You will be moved into the recovery area and watched closely. </p></li><li><p>You may go home the same day. Or you may need to stay in the facility overnight. </p></li></ul></Section><Section title=""After the Test""><h2>What happens after cochlear implant surgery?</h2><p>When leaving the hospital, you will be given directions on how to care for the incisions. You’ll also learn how to change dressings and care for your stitches. You will also be given directions on how to wash the scalp and head, and how to shower. You may be advised to make certain diet changes during recovery. A follow-up appointment is made for about 1 week later to inspect the incisions and remove the stitches. </p><p>You should report increased pain, drainage, or fever to your healthcare provider after the procedure. </p><p>You will have some time to heal after the initial surgery before the implant process is completed. This lets the swelling go down and the implant to fit correctly. About 4 to 6 weeks after the surgery, the external parts of the cochlear implant will be added. These include a microphone and speech processor. This is where the implant is programmed and activated. The external parts work with the internal part of the implant. </p><p>You will also learn the basics of using and caring for the implant. You may need to return for several visits over a few days for adjustments. Further fine-tuning may take place over several months. Learning to use a cochlear implant is a slow process. It will likely require visits with speech-language pathologists, audiologists, counselors, and teachers. But with commitment, you can have an improved quality of life with a cochlear implant.  </p><p>People who get an inner ear infection should get medical care until the infection goes away. Untreated middle ear infections can go on to cause meningitis. Vaccines don't end the risk for meningitis. The surgeon or another surgeon experienced in cochlear implants also should check any discharge, pain, or swelling in the ear with the implant. The surgeon should also assess any redness around the processor behind the ear, abnormal ear symptoms, or a watery nasal discharge. </p><p>Get a checkup every year by an audiologist to map and reprogram the implant. </p></Section><Section title=""Next Steps""><h2>Next steps</h2><p>Before you agree to the test or procedure make sure you know: </p><ul><li><p>The name of the test or procedure</p></li><li><p>The reason you are having the test or procedure </p></li><li><p>What results to expect and what they mean </p></li><li><p>The risks and benefits of the test or procedure </p></li><li><p>What the possible side effects or complications are </p></li><li><p>When and where you are to have the test or procedure </p></li><li><p>Who will do the test or procedure and what that person’s qualifications are </p></li><li><p>What would happen if you did not have the test or procedure </p></li><li><p>Any alternative tests or procedures to think about </p></li><li><p>When and how will you get the results </p></li><li><p>Who to call after the test or procedure if you have questions or problems </p></li><li><p>How much will you have to pay for the test or procedure </p></li></ul></Section></body>",['20230209-150910'],"[{'name': 'Overview', 'body': ""<h2>What is cochlear implant surgery?</h2><p>If a person has severe hearing loss, a cochlear implant may help.

803,135-82,"<body><h1>Choosing a Bariatric Surgery Procedure</h1><Section><h2>What is bariatric surgery?</h2><p>Bariatric surgery is a type of surgery to help you lose weight. It's a choice for some people who are obese and have not been able to lose weight with other methods. Your healthcare provider might discuss bariatric surgery with you if you are morbidly obese or if you are obese and have an obesity-related health problem. These include diabetes, sleep apnea, asthma, high blood pressure, and arthritis. Diabetes and certain other health problems may get better with weight loss. </p><p>There are several different bariatric surgery procedures. The type of bariatric surgery that works best for you will depend on several factors. These include your general health, your health needs, and your own preference. </p></Section><Section><h2>What types of bariatric surgeries are available?</h2><p>The most common types of bariatric surgery are sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass, and adjustable gastric banding.  </p><p>Lap banding is also known as laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. During lap banding, your surgeon places an adjustable band around the top of your stomach. Your surgeon also places a small device called a port under the skin of your stomach. A thin tube leads from the band to the port. Fluid is injected into the port and flows to the band to make it squeeze tighter around the top of the stomach. Fluid can also be removed through the port to loosen the band if it's too tight. The band around your stomach reduces the amount of food that you can eat at 1 time. </p><p>Gastric bypass is another common type of bariatric surgery. It's also called a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This surgery also reduces the amount of food you can eat at 1 time. And it reduces the number of calories and nutrients you can absorb from the foods you eat. During gastric bypass, your surgeon separates part of the stomach to create a small pouch. The pouch is then attached to a part of your small intestine. This small pouch holds less food, making you feel full faster. As food bypasses the rest of the stomach and upper part of your small intestine, you absorb fewer calories and nutrients. </p><p>Sleeve gastrectomy is a type of surgery that removes up to 85% of the stomach. It's also known as a gastric sleeve or vertical sleeve gastrectomy. The surgery turns the stomach into a narrow tube that looks like a sleeve. The sleeve holds much less food, and you feel full faster. Your stomach also makes less of 1 of the hormones that causes hunger. </p><p>A less common type of weight-loss surgery is called biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS). In this procedure, your surgeon removes part of the stomach to create a gastric sleeve, as with the sleeve gastrectomy. The sleeve is then attached to a part of the lower small intestine. The sleeve holds much less food, and your body absorbs far fewer calories and nutrients from food. </p><p>Surgeons can do most of these types of surgeries as minimally invasive procedures, known as laparoscopic surgery. This type of surgery is done with small incisions, a small camera, and small tools. It's most likely that your surgeon will use a laparoscopic approach for your bariatric surgery.  </p><p>Your healthcare provider can tell you more if 1 of these procedures might be better for you. Many people find second opinions helpful when making a major surgical decision. </p></Section><Section><h2>What are the advantages and disadvantages of each type of bariatric surgery? </h2><h3>Lap banding</h3><p>Lap banding is a simpler surgery. After lap band surgery, it's fairly easy to loosen or tighten the band, but you may need more visits to your healthcare provider for band adjustments. A tighter band might help you feel fuller sooner. This might help you lose weight more quickly. If you have lap banding, your risk of serious complications right after your surgery is low. This surgery can lead to loss of 40% to 50% of your weight. But results vary a lot between different people. You might not lose as much weight as you would like.  </p><p>Lap banding might not be right for you if you think you'll have a hard time following a nutritional program. For example, if you drink a lot of high-calorie liquids, the lap band may not help you lose weight. You might develop heartburn or reflux if the band is tight. The band sometimes slips out of position and can cause an obstruction of the stomach. Some bands have to be removed because of this. Sometimes there can be issues with the band leaking or with the port.  </p><h3>Sleeve gastrectomy</h3><p>Sleeve gastrectomy is more complex than the band, because much of the stomach is removed. Food still travels the same way it did before surgery, and some vitamins like iron and calcium are absorbed almost the same way as before surgery. If you need an upper endoscopy later, the endoscopist can see the same structures. This is different from a gastric bypass, where it's much harder to see other parts of the stomach and the duodenum. You most likely can still take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines after surgery, although they increase the risk for an ulcer. You may lose from 50 to 100 pounds with a sleeve gastrectomy, if you eat and exercise as you should do. </p><p>As time goes by, the sleeve can dilate, or get larger. This means that you could eat more food and gain weight back. Another risk is heartburn or reflux, which can happen after surgery. You might need to take medicines for this. If you already have heartburn or reflux before surgery, doing a sleeve gastrectomy could make it much worse.  </p><h3>Gastric bypass</h3><p>Gastric bypass is more complex surgery than sleeve gastrectomy. It works very well for weight loss, and you can lose 100 pounds or more. It's one of the best operations to improve or resolve diabetes. It is also a very good operation to resolve heartburn or reflux. The weight loss goes on for about a year, and then it's usual to see some weight regain. It's very important to keep up with eating the right foods and to keep physically active. </p><p>You are also more likely to have problems with nutritional deficiency. You will have to take multivitamins, calcium, and vitamin B-12 regularly. You can get ulcers at the bottom of the stomach pouch if you smoke, or if you take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines on a regular basis. Because the operation is on the small bowel as well, you might get a small bowel obstruction later in life and need surgery for that. If you eat the wrong things like sugars, you might have the dumping syndrome (abdominal cramping and diarrhea). But this syndrome can usually be avoided by eating the right foods. Because the bowel gets connected in 2 areas, there is also a risk of leakage of the bowel contents, which can require more surgery. </p><h3>BPD-DS procedure</h3><p>A BPD-DS procedure (the duodenal switch) may be most helpful for a person who is extremely obese. You can lose over 150 or 200 pounds with it. It's likely the best operation for diabetes. It also can keep the weight off for many years. It has a higher risk of some complications than other weight-loss surgery. Because fats are not absorbed very well, if you do eat fatty foods, you may have loose bowel movements or diarrhea. You also need to take more vitamins than with a gastric bypass. The duodenal switch has a higher risk of nutritional and vitamin deficiencies. You will need to see your healthcare provider periodically to have check-ups. </p></Section><Section><h2>What are the risks of bariatric surgery?</h2><p>All surgery has risks. Your risks may vary according to your general health, your age, the type of surgery you choose, and the amount of weight you need to lose. Talk with your healthcare provider about the risks that most apply to you. Risks of bariatric surgery include: </p><ul><li><p>Bleeding</p></li><li><p>Infection, including a leak from the staple lines from the stomach or small bowel </p></li><li><p>Blockage of your bowels (intestinal blockage)</p></li><li><p>Blood clots in your legs that can travel to your lungs and heart </p></li><li><p>Heart attack</p></li><li><p>Need for follow-up surgery</p></li><li><p>Gallstones (a later complication), which requires surgery to remove the gallbladder </p></li><li><p>Nutritional deficiencies from poor absorption (a later complication) </p></li><li><p>Mental health problems after the procedure</p></li><li><p> Poor wound healing, including scarring of the incisions, and a hernia at the incisions </p></li><li><p> Problems with the band or the port that often need more surgery </p></li><li><p> Gastric reflux﻿ </p></li></ul><p>There is also a risk that you might regain weight after you have lost it. </p></Section><Section><h2>How does surgery compare with medical treatment?</h2><p>People who get surgery tend to lose much more weight than people who get medical therapy for their weight loss, as long as they follow the recommendations for change in their diet and physical activity. This also means that surgery is more likely to help improve their health conditions linked to obesity, such as diabetes or sleep apnea. Some people can have large weight loss with medical therapy alone, but most morbidly obese people won't be able to keep the weight off. Some people don't lose as much weight as they want after surgery, and some people can regain weight after they have lost it after surgery.  </p></Section><Section><h2>What should I look for in a bariatric surgery program?</h2><p>Look for an accredited surgery center with a support staff. Support staff should include a dietitian, counselor, and nurses or physician assistants who have had experience in weight loss surgery. Your healthcare provider should be board certified. The center should also provide you with an education program. The program is to help prepare you for before, during, and life after surgery. This is very important to help ensure good results after surgery. The program will likely take several months to prepare you for surgery. And it should provide long-term follow-up after surgery. </p></Section><Section><h2>How will I need to manage my condition after surgery?</h2><p>For the rest of your life, you need to work with your healthcare providers to stay healthy. Your medical team will keep track of your health, especially as you lose weight quickly in the first 6 months or so after your surgery. Weight loss tends to be at its peak around a year after surgery. </p><p>You will get instructions about how to adapt to your new diet after your surgery. You will likely be on liquid nutrition for a few weeks after surgery. Over time, you'll start to eat soft foods and then solid foods. If you eat too much or too quickly, you may have abdominal pain or vomiting. You'll learn how to know when your new stomach is full. </p><p>Your healthcare provider will give you more instructions about your diet. These may vary depending on the type of surgery you had. You'll need to learn good habits like choosing healthy foods and not skipping meals. Your healthcare provider or nutritionist may also need to screen you for low levels of certain nutrients.

It's a choice for some people who are obese and have not been able to lose weight with other methods. Your healthcare provider might discuss bariatric surgery with you if you are morbidly obese, or if you are obese and have a medical problem, such as diabetes, sleep apnea, high blood pressure, or osteoarthritis. Diabetes and certain other health problems linked to obesity may get better with weight loss. </p><p>Before having surgery, you'll meet with a team of healthcare providers who will make sure the surgery is the best treatment for you. They will look at your general health, your mental and emotional health, and other factors. You will need to make some changes as well to prepare for surgery.  </p></Section><Section><h2>How do I get ready in the weeks and months before bariatric surgery? </h2><p>You'll need to make some healthy lifestyle changes in the months before your surgery. You'll also need to plan for changes in diet, exercise, and lifestyle after the surgery. This will help lower your chances of complications. It will also help make sure that you will lose the right amount of weight. You may need to meet with members of your healthcare team several times in the months leading up to your surgery. </p><p>Several months before your surgery, your surgeon or dietitian will put you on a specific diet. This will help you lose some weight before your surgery. Losing some weight before the surgery will reduce your risk of complications. This diet will be high in protein and low in carbohydrates and fat. This diet will help keep you from losing too much muscle mass. Your healthcare provider may also have you keep a food diary during this time. </p><p>Your surgeon or dietitian can give you details about what specific diet you should follow. This diet may be similar to the one that you will need to follow after your surgery. Or, you may be told to follow a low-calorie liquid diet for a couple of weeks before or after your surgery. </p><p>Your healthcare team might also have you start an exercise program. This may also help you lose weight before your surgery. It can also help start positive habits you will need to keep up after your procedure. Your healthcare provider can tell you more about what types of exercise are safe for you. </p><p>If you smoke, you'll need to stop smoking at least 6 weeks before your surgery. Smoking raises the risk of complications after surgery. Talk to your healthcare provider about ways to help you quit. Many bariatric surgeons will not do surgery on people who are still actively smoking. </p><p>Some people may benefit from counseling as they get ready for surgery. Many people who are obese have eating disorders. These poor eating habits often have an emotional link. Working on any emotional concerns with a therapist may help you have a better result after surgery. </p><p>Your healthcare provider may have more directions about how to get ready for your surgery.

Talk to your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, which includes prescription, over-the-counter medicines herbs and supplements. You may need to stop taking medicines such as blood thinners before your surgery. Know which medicines you may need to stop taking. Also know how long before the procedure you should top taking them. Don't stop any medicine without talking to your healthcare provider first. </p><p>Also tell them about any recent changes in your health, like a cough, or fever, or any new medicines. In some cases, your healthcare provider might want to postpone your surgery. </p><p>You may also want to ask a family member or friend to help you at home after the surgery. </p><p>Follow any directions you are given for not eating or drinking before the surgery. </p><p>In some cases, your healthcare provider might order more tests just before your surgery. These tests may include: </p><ul><li><p>Electrocardiogram to check your heart rhythm </p></li><li><p>Blood tests to test for infection or other conditions </p></li><li><p>Chest X-rays to evaluate any lung conditions  </p></li><li><p>Nutritional tests, to see whether you are deficient in certain nutrients </p></li></ul><p>Learn as much about the surgery as you can.

805,135-84,"<body><h1>Evaluation for Bariatric Surgery</h1><Section><h2>What is bariatric surgery?</h2><p>Bariatric surgery is a type of surgery to help you lose weight. There are several different bariatric procedures. This surgery is a choice for some people who are obese and have not been able to lose weight with other methods, such as diet and exercise. Your healthcare provider might discuss bariatric surgery with you if you are obese. Or they may discuss it if you are overweight and have a health problem, such as diabetes. Diabetes and certain other health problems may get better with weight loss. </p></Section><Section><h2>What are the benefits of bariatric surgery?</h2><p>Bariatric surgery may help you lose a large amount of excess weight and keep it off if you continue with diet and lifestyle changes. Excess weight can cause health problems, such as: </p><ul><li><p>Diabetes</p></li><li><p>Osteoarthritis</p></li><li><p>High blood pressure</p></li><li><p>Heart disease</p></li><li><p>Stroke</p></li><li><p>Sleep apnea</p></li><li><p>Liver disease</p></li><li><p>Gastrointestinal problems</p></li><li><p>Infertility</p></li><li><p>Certain lung diseases, such as asthma </p></li><li><p>Certain cancers</p></li><li><p>Psychological problems</p></li></ul><p>Weight loss will reduce your risk of some of these health conditions. If you already have 1 or more of these health problems, weight loss may lessen symptoms and improve your overall health. In some cases, a health problem linked to excessive weight may go away after weight loss. </p><p>Healthcare providers most often advise bariatric surgery to people with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or greater, which is called morbid obesity. BMI is a method of screening for a weight category using a person's height and weight for calculation. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 means overweight. A BMI of 30 or higher means obese. Your healthcare provider might also suggest bariatric surgery if your BMI is between 35 and 40 and you have a medical problem that may get better with weight loss, such as diabetes, sleep apnea, high blood pressure, or osteoarthritis. </p><p>People who get surgery tend to lose much more weight than people who get medical therapy for their weight loss. This means that surgery is more likely to help with medical conditions linked to obesity, such as diabetes or sleep apnea. But the results do vary. Some people can have large weight loss with medical therapy alone. And some people do not lose as much weight as they want after surgery. </p></Section><Section><h2>What are the risks of bariatric surgery?</h2><p>All surgery has risks. Your risks may vary according to your general health, your age, the type of surgery you choose, and the amount of weight you need to lose. Talk with your healthcare provider about the risks that most apply to you. Risks of bariatric surgery include: </p><ul><li><p>Bleeding</p></li><li><p>Wound infection</p></li><li><p>Leaks from the staple lines or connections </p></li><li><p>Pneumonia </p></li><li><p>Blockage of your bowels (intestinal obstruction) </p></li><li><p>Blood clots in your legs or lungs  </p></li><li><p>Heart attack</p></li><li><p>Need for follow-up surgery </p></li><li><p>Gallstones (a later complication) </p></li><li><p>Nutritional deficiencies (a later complication) </p></li><li><p>Psychological difficulties after the procedure </p></li></ul></Section><Section><h2>Who evaluates me for bariatric surgery?</h2><p>Bariatric surgery is not the only treatment for obesity. Your healthcare provider may want you to try other treatments first. These may include working with a dietitian or using a prescribed weight loss medicine. </p><p>Your medical team will only do the surgery if they know it will give you health benefits. For the surgery to be a success, you will need to make lifelong changes to your diet and lifestyle. Your medical team will want to know that you are ready and committed to make these lifestyle changes so that surgery is successful. </p><p>You will need to go through an in-depth screening process to be approved for bariatric surgery. This is done to find out if you are ready for the surgery and if it will help you. You'll also want to find out if your health insurance plan will cover the costs of the surgery. As part of your evaluation, you'll need to give some details about your weight and diet history. </p><p>To be approved for the surgery, you'll need to meet with healthcare providers, such as: </p><ul><li><p>Your surgeon, who must confirm that you are a good candidate for surgery</p></li><li><p>A mental health professional, who can assess your psychological health and readiness for the surgery </p></li><li><p>A registered dietitian, who will look at your diet and eating habits and help you begin to make the needed changes </p></li><li><p>A primary care provider, who can assess your general health and readiness for surgery </p></li><li><p>A heart healthcare provider, who can make sure your heart is healthy for surgery </p></li><li><p>A lung healthcare provider, who can make sure your lungs are healthy for surgery </p></li></ul><p>You may need to work with these healthcare providers for several months before you can get approval. They need to make sure you are in good mental and physical shape for the surgery. You may need to work with your primary healthcare provider and a dietitian to lose some weight and stop smoking in the months before your surgery. This helps reduce your risk of complications after the surgery. You might need to work with more healthcare providers if you have other medical or social problems. Your team of healthcare providers must agree that the surgery is safe and would be beneficial for you. </p><p>Checking your mental readiness is a vital part of the approval process. Bariatric surgery is a big personal commitment. The surgery will permanently change your eating habits. To get approved for the surgery, you'll need to show that you fully understand the risks and benefits. Support from your partner, family, and friends can also be important for your mental readiness for the surgery. </p></Section><Section><h2>What tests do I need for bariatric surgery approval?</h2><p>As part of the approval process, you'll need physical exams and testing. This is to make sure you are healthy enough for the surgery and recovery. You may need tests, such as: </p><ul><li><p>Blood tests to check for anemia, infection, hormone levels, kidney function, and more</p></li><li><p>Screening for nutrient deficiencies</p></li><li><p>Chest X-ray, to help evaluate your heart and lungs</p></li><li><p>Echocardiogram, if more information about your heart is necessary</p></li><li><p>Electrocardiogram, to evaluate your heart rhythm</p></li><li><p>Pulmonary function tests, to evaluate your lungs</p></li><li><p>A sleep study, to see if you have sleep apnea</p></li><li><p>An upper GI or an upper endoscopy, to examine your stomach</p></li><li><p>An upper abdominal ultrasound, to examine your liver and gallbladder </p></li></ul><p>Your healthcare providers may ask you to lose weight before surgery. If you smoke, your surgeon will likely need you to stop smoking to go ahead with surgery. These lifestyle changes help to make the surgery and recovery safer for you.  </p></Section><Section><h2>What are realistic weight loss goals?</h2><p>It's important to have realistic weight loss goals going into the surgery. Most people don't lose all of their excess weight after surgery. Depending on the type of surgery you have, you may lose one-half to two-thirds of your excess body weight. Your healthcare provider can give you a more exact idea of what you can expect. Are you hoping to lose 50 to 100 pounds, or over 100 pounds? You should tell your surgical team how much weight you are hoping to lose as a result of the surgical procedure. It can help you select a procedure that can help you reach your goals.  </p><p>Losing this amount of weight may help any health conditions you have, even if you still carry some excess weight. You may be able to reduce or stop some of the medicines that you take. You may also have more energy and a more positive self-image. Having a realistic weight loss goal can help keep you motivated. It can help keep you on track with your good eating habits. During your evaluation, your healthcare providers will give you a realistic idea of how much you can expect to lose after your surgery, depending on which bariatric surgical procedure you will have done. </p></Section></body>",['20230221-120851'],[],11/24/2014,2/21/2023,02/01/23,Document,2/21/2023 12:08:51,English,Evaluation for Bariatric Surgery,<p>Bariatric surgery is a type of surgery to help you lose weight.
